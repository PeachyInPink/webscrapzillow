Rockies Real Estate Rumble


The Start:

One idyllic Saturday morning, as my iced vanilla matcha latte was doing its best to perk me up, a New York Times article with something along the lines of "Half of Gen Z thinks they need to win the lottery to buy a home" [1] almost made me spit out my coffee. If that's not a wake-up call, I don’t know what is.

I have always been smitten with the splendors of Colorado. I mean, who wouldn't want to wake up to those Rockies, even if the altitude makes the coffee boil at weird temperatures? Add to that mix, family, friends, and the not-so-secret hope of bumping into an ultra-marathon runner niche celebrity (yes, they are a thing). Fueled by this desire--and perhaps too much caffeine--, I dove headfirst into the sprawling, often confusing, digital jungle of Zillow. Objective? Find that hidden gem of a home without breaking the bank... or my spirit.

Zooming In: Denver's Dynamite Suburbs

The spotlight is on five suburbs, each uniquely charming and just a stone's throw away from Denver's bustling downtown.

Aurora: Not just a Disney princess! A growing hub with a mix of the urban and the suburban.

Arvada: A hint of historic charm, coupled with modern-day amenities.

Westminster: A perfect blend of contemporary living with touches of nature's splendor.

Littleton: Rich in history, culture, and – fingers crossed – affordable homes.

Lakewood: Lakes? Check. Woods? Check. The dream Colorado vibes? Double-check.

The chatter around town is that these places are the next big thing for young families seeking affordability without skimping on the perks of suburban living.
